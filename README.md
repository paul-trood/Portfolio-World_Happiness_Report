## World Happiness Report 2005 - 2021

The World Happiness Report is an annual report released by the UN using data collected from the Gallup World Poll. The report is a survey of the overall state of global happiness. Respondents are asked to imagine a ladder on a scale of 1 (worst life imaginable) to 10 (best possible life). This concept is known as a Cantril Ladder.

The current six columns (variables) preceding Happiness Score estimate the extent these factors contribute to life evaluations:

* economic production (GDP)
* social support: having someone to count on in times of trouble (friends or family)
* life expectancy: life expectancies at birth are based on the data extracted from the World Health Organization
* freedom : “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”
* absence of corruption: national average of the survey re-sponses to two questions in the GWP: Are there perceptions of widespread corruption in business and government
* generosity: “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?”


These factors do not directly contribute to the Happiness Score, however they can help to explain differences between countries and why some rank higher than others. The variables were determined mainly from the averages of (0: No) or (1: Yes) responses from respondents that participated in the survey.

Throughout the analysis `Ladder Score` will refer to Happiness score (it is the national average response to the question of life evaluations; subjective well-being)
* What are the trends of World Happiness from 2005 to 2021?
* What factors contribute most to world happiness?
* Which Regions are the "most happy" (Highest Score) ?
* What countries have the highest and lowest happiness scores?
* Which countries have a happiness score equal to or higher than United States?

We'll be utilizing the Python programming language and the Pandas library to perform the analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn will be our primary libraries for visualizing our data.
