World Happiness Report 2015 to 2021


## World Happiness Report (2015 - 2021)

The World Happiness Report is an annual report released by the UN using data collected from the Gallup World Poll. The Report is a survey of the overall state of global happiness. Respondents are asked to think of how the best possible life for themselves from 1 (worst) to 10 (absolute best) and to rank their current life circumstances as a number between the rankings of 1 to 10.

The current six columns preceding Happiness Score estimate the extent of these factors contribute to life evaluations:
* economic production 
* social support 
* life expectancy
* freedom
* absence of corruption
* generosity  

These factors do not directly contribute to the Happiness Score, however they can help to explain differences between countries and why some rank higher than others.
The final factor (Dystopia), is a hypothetical country that contains the the least satisfied individuals. It is essentially the benchmark to which every country can be compared to favorably.


* What are the trends of World Happiness from 2015 to 2021?
* What factors contribute most to world happiness?
* Which Regions are the "most happy" (Highest Score) ?
* Using Income Group classifications, which country / income group has the highest Happiness Scores?
* What countries have the highest and lowest happiness scores?
* Which countries have a happiness score equal to or higher than United States?

We'll be using an additional dataset that outlines development indicators of all countries. From this dataset we are interested in the income group that a particular country has been assigned by the World Bank.

The World Bank assigns each country one of four income groups:
* Low income
* Lower-middle income
* Upper-middle income
* High income

The World Bank uses Gross national income per capita as the criteria for assignment
Sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes.

With these income classifications we can answer questions such as: of which income group has the highest/lowest score.
